# GLBS: Group Lasso-Based Band Selection for Hyperspectral Image Classification.
Created by Wentao Bao at Wuhan University.

### Introduction
**GLBS** is an algorithm for band selection and multi-label landcover classification. It is the first that introduces the group lasso algorithm for the band selection problem of multilabel land-cover classification for HSIs. The paper of proposed algorithm (see [GLBS paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8113687/)) has been submited to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL).
