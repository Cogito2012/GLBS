# GLBS: Group Lasso-Based Band Selection for Hyperspectral Image Classification.
Created by Wentao Bao at Wuhan University.

### Introduction
**GLBS** is an algorithm for band selection and multi-label landcover classification. It is the first that introduces the group lasso algorithm for the band selection problem of multilabel land-cover classification for HSIs. The paper of proposed algorithm (see [GLBS paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8113687/)) has been submited to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL).

We have visualized the main results of GLBS on Indian Pines dataset as shown in following picture. GLBS is compared with an unsupervised algorithm [E-FDPC](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7161371), and two supervised algorithms, [SBMLR](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243411001371) and [RSBS](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7104131).
